Hi there, my name is Shuhan, based in San Francisco, Bay area.

With a mixed background in traditional art and film, I'm sensitive to color and light. I'm really grateful for the moment when I picked up my camera and immediately felt the freedom to show people how beautiful the way they are. My goal is always to create a comfortable shooting environment for every client as well as to record unforgettable memories at a reasonable price.

You can find my photos below, let's start the journey together!
